# Testing Data Apps 
This repository covers several strategies for testing Data Apps. Depending on the details of the app, one or more of the following strategies may be appropriate:

1. Test the app against two datasets: One with "bad data" (edge cases and previous failures) and another "Good dataset" to test the statistical properties of the 
2. Verify certain properties of newly loaded data before continuing the data pipeline.
3. 

Throughout this repository, I use a previous project (found [here]()) as an example.
